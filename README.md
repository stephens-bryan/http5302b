***HUMBERFOLIO README***

Hi HTTP5302B! This is the design team checking in - we've included in this Git upload the public facing pages and the relevant files to include. This includes:

- Header, footer, sidebar (found in "includes")

- Public facing pages (found in the root folder)
        - Profile pages
        - Student login
        - Student account settings
        - Student project upload/settings ("my-projects.php")
        - Individual project settings ("project-settings.php", I'd imagine that this will eventually change to be something aking to "projectX-settings.php")
    
- Our own stylesheet and Materialize's css file (found in "css")

- Our own js files and Materialize's js file (found in "js"). 
Our own javascript is currently broken up into different files (i.e. "menu.js") - feel free to compile it into one file if you wish, you'll just have to change the relevant code in header to link the file if you change the name.

- Images used (found in "img")

- Finally, there's a "TEMPLATE.php" file that we've used to create new pages. Simply add in your content where indicated and it works nicely with including the header, footer, and sidebar. If you need to make a new page simply place your content in the space where indicated.

David unfortunately had something come up so this commit does not have his code yet but it will be along shortly. All the data included is placeholder data. There are a couple styling tweaks that still need to be done but these changes are minor. The CSS needs to be indexed, organized, and id/class names need to be adjusted as well (which will happen in a commit in the near future). Please don't hestiate to contact any of myself, Selim, David, or Natasha if you have any questions, concerns, or need anything from our end.
